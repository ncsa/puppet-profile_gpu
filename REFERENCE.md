## Classes

### <a name="profile_gpu"></a>`profile_gpu`

GPU specific host configuration

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
include profile_gpu
```

### <a name="profile_gpudcgminstall"></a>`profile_gpu::dcgm::install`

Installs the NVIDIA DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager)

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
include profile_gpu::dcgm::install
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `profile_gpu::dcgm::install` class:

* [`bind_mount_install`](#bind_mount_install)
* [`bind_dst_path`](#bind_dst_path)
* [`bind_mnt_options`](#bind_mnt_options)
* [`bind_parent_dst_mount`](#bind_parent_dst_mount)
* [`bind_src_path`](#bind_src_path)
* [`dcgm_version`](#dcgm_version)
* [`install_dcgm`](#install_dcgm)
* [`packages`](#packages)

##### <a name="bind_mount_install"></a>`bind_mount_install`

Data type: `Boolean`

Boolean to set if this install requires a bind mount

There is no completely safe default value for this, so
no values is set and must be set individually wherever
this is used

Only set this to true if DCGM install files would
clobber a shared filesystem. Commonly needed on systems
where /usr/local is mounted as a shared filesystem. In which
case you'd set this to true. If the DCGM install would not
clobber any shared filesystems, then set this to false

##### <a name="bind_dst_path"></a>`bind_dst_path`

Data type: `String`

Destination location for bind mount to install DCGM into

Only needed on systems where DCGM install files would
clobber a shared filesystem. Commonly needed on systems
where /usr/local is mounted as a shared filesystem. In which
case you'd most likely set this to /usr/local/dcgm

##### <a name="bind_mnt_options"></a>`bind_mnt_options`

Data type: `String`

Bind mount options to use

Only needed on systems where DCGM install files would
clobber a shared filesystem. Commonly needed on systems
where /usr/local is mounted as a shared filesystem.

##### <a name="bind_parent_dst_mount"></a>`bind_parent_dst_mount`

Data type: `String`

The parent mount which bind_dst_path depends on

Only needed on systems where DCGM install files would
clobber a shared filesystem. Commonly needed on systems
where /usr/local is mounted as a shared filesystem. In which
case you'd most likely set this to /usr/local

##### <a name="bind_src_path"></a>`bind_src_path`

Data type: `String`

Source path for bind mount

Only needed on systems where DCGM install files would
clobber a shared filesystem. Commonly needed on systems
where /usr/local is mounted as a shared filesystem. This path
can be set to any path that's local to the node (ie not a shared
mount). Commonly you can use /var/log/dcgm

##### <a name="dcgm_version"></a>`dcgm_version`

Data type: `String`

Specify what version of DCGM to install

This is important because we have made modifications to the
scripts (to allow it to listen on localhost) which are likely
to break in new versions. See version in data/common.yaml
for versions known to work

##### <a name="install_dcgm"></a>`install_dcgm`

Data type: `Boolean`

Whether to install NVIDIA DCGM

##### <a name="packages"></a>`packages`

Data type: `Array[String]`

Required packages for Nvidia DCGM

### <a name="profile_gpudcgmtelegraf"></a>`profile_gpu::dcgm::telegraf`

Configures telegraf reporting for DCGM

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
include profile_gpu::dcgm::telegraf
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `profile_gpu::dcgm::telegraf` class:

* [`dcgm_telegraf_port`](#dcgm_telegraf_port)
* [`dcgm_telegraf_py_port`](#dcgm_telegraf_py_port)
* [`enable`](#enable)

##### <a name="dcgm_telegraf_port"></a>`dcgm_telegraf_port`

Data type: `Integer`

Port that telegraf socket will listen on, defaults to 8094

##### <a name="dcgm_telegraf_py_port"></a>`dcgm_telegraf_py_port`

Data type: `Integer`

Port that DCGM python process will listen on, defaults to 5556

##### <a name="enable"></a>`enable`

Data type: `Boolean`

Enable or disable telegraf reporting for DCGM
